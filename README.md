# Wireframing

## 📌 Introduction  
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the layout and structure of a digital product such as a website or mobile app.  
It focuses on **what goes where** on a page rather than the final design elements like colors or images.  

## 🎯 Importance of Wireframing  
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process because it helps:  
- 📝 **Visualize Ideas**: Translates abstract concepts into a clear structure.  
- 🤝 **Improve Collaboration**: Provides a common reference point for designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- ⚡ **Save Time & Resources**: Identifies usability issues early before investing in full design or development.  
- 🔄 **Support Iteration**: Allows quick changes and feedback during the planning stage.  

## ✅ Conclusion  
Wireframing is an essential first step in user experience (UX) design, ensuring that the product’s layout is user-friendly, functional, and aligned with project goals.
